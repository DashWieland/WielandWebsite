<h2>Weekly bike traffic in Seattle</h2>
<p>This week’s #TidyTuesday dataset is bike traffic in Seattle. Interestingly,
this isn’t geographic data-though we could add that by finding the coordinates
of the counting stations-so instead I thought it might be interesting to
capture the seasonality of bike traffic at different counting stations.</p>
<p>Start by loading the required packages and downloading the data from GitHub.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(RColorBrewer)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>bike_traffic &lt;- readr::read_csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-04-02/bike_traffic.csv&quot;, col_types = &#39;cccdd&#39;) </code></pre>

<h2>Prepping data for plotting</h2>
<div id="formatting-dates-with-lubridate" class="section level3">
<h3>Formatting dates with lubridate</h3>
<p>The first thing to do is get our dates in a workable format. Per the readme
file for this dataset, the dates are in M/D/Y H/M/S format, so we’ll use
the mdy_hms() function from the lubridate package to get an actual date column.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bike_traffic$lubri_date = mdy_hms(bike_traffic$date)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="new-variables-with-mutate" class="section level3">
<h3>New variables with mutate()</h3>
<p>Now that we have a date, let’s give ourselves some options for plotting. The
lubridate package has handy “floor” functions that round a date to the
specied unit (e.g., month, day, or year). We’ll create floored month, week,
and year columns, as well as a log of the bike count since there are some
extreme outliers. Note: we won’t use all of these in the resulting plot, but we
could if we wanted!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bike_taffic_dated &lt;- bike_traffic %&gt;%
  mutate(floor_month_year = month(lubri_date, label = TRUE),
         floor_week_year = week(lubri_date),
         floor_day_year = yday(lubri_date), 
         log_bike_count = log(bike_count))</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="grouping-and-summarising" class="section level3">
<h3>Grouping and summarising</h3>
<p>Now let’s group by year and crossing before summarizing our mean bike count.
We’ll get back a new column from the mutate function labeled “mean_bike_count.”
This is the mean bike count for each crossing across all years.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bike_taffic_grouped &lt;- bike_taffic_dated %&gt;%
  group_by(floor_week_year, crossing) %&gt;%
  summarise(mean_bike_count = mean(bike_count, na.rm = TRUE))</code></pre>
</div>

<div id="ready-to-plot" class="section level2">
<h2>Ready to plot</h2>
<p>I won’t explain the inner workings of this code at the moment, but rest assured
that most of it is styling. The meat of the plot is charting each station’s
average bike count in a line chart (grouped by color and counting station) and
then wrapping that line chart into a circle using coord_polor().</p>
<p>The other item of note is that the annotations for the time of year are added
with the geom_vline() and geom_text() arguements at the end. Those can be
finicky to control, so customize at your own risk!</p>
